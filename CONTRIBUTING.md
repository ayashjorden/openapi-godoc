# Contributing

First, thank you for contributing! We love and encourage pull requests from everyone.

Before submitting major changes, here are a few guidelines to follow:

1. Check the [open issues](https://github.com/tink3rlabs/openapi-godoc/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/tink3rlabs/openapi-godoc/pulls) for existing discussions.
2. Open an [issue](https://github.com/tink3rlabs/openapi-godoc/issues) first, to discuss a new feature or enhancement.
3. Write tests, and make sure the test suite passes locally and on CI.
4. Open a pull request, and reference the relevant issue(s).
5. After receiving feedback, [squash](https://gitready.com/advanced/2009/02/10/squashing-commits-with-rebase.html) your commits and add a [great commit message](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-write-better-git-commit-messages/).
